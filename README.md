Pen and Paper is a simple yet powerful tracking tool for fountain pen enthusiasts. It allows you to catalog your pens, inks, and active pairings all in one place. Record details such as brand, nib size, ink color, fill date, and personal notes, making it easy to manage your collection and track usage. With Pen and Paper, youâ€™ll always know which pens are inked, how different inks perform, and keep your writing experience organized and enjoyable.

## Background Information

I created this app because I wanted a way to track all of my fountain pen and ink usage. It's simple and easy to use. You can see your pens and inks clearly sorted by brand.
